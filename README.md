# nmap-script-to-collect-IPs
This script acquires the IPs on all Eth interfaces, then formats them down to 4 octets
This script only works in a VM environment - does not work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

This script has been developed as part of my 3rd year college Networking project in 2018, which was about building a network infrastructure for a secondary school - the project consisted of the physical layer, data link layer and the network layer.

The code has been developed over a strech of time with the aid of online tutorials and ITLC (IT Learning Center) tutors.

The purpose of creating this script was to gain extra marks for the final project by displaying the ability to script and also having the script execute in an intended way to show results of IPs of all the users on the LAN.
